# acme
Programs written in the programming language named [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)) for interacting with the text editor named [Acme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_(text_editor)).

## Disclaimer
Some of these programs are not my own work.  
I've attempted to preserve copyright licenses in the relevant files to attribute the appropriate authors,  
but please let me know if I've missed something.

This repository exists so that all the programs I commonly use from the Acme text editor 
can be installed easily and with a single command when using machines or user-accounts that are new to me.

## Installation:
`go get github.com/aoeu/acme/...`
